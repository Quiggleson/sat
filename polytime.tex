    \begin{abstract}
        This paper includes the presentation of a polynomial time algorithm to
        solve 3SAT. It begins with the problem definition and format of various
        parts of the problem. It then offers lemmas of important aspects of 
        the 3SAT problem along with their corresponding proofs. Next, it describes
        the algorithm that uses these lemmas to solve 3SAT in polynomial time. Next, it proves
        that the algorithm works for any general case of 3SAT. The algorithm relies
        on the fact that an instance of 3SAT is unsatisfiable iff contradicting
        1-terminal clauses can be derived in polynomial time. Finally it shows that, 
        because 3SAT is NP-Complete and 3SAT can be solved in polynomial time, 
        P equals NP.

    \section{Introduction}

        This section introduces the 3SAT problem and the implications of
        solving it in polynomial time.

        As seen in (Cook's Paper),
        The boolean satisfiability problem is given as a set of terminals, $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$,
        each of which can be assigned a value of True or False,
        combined by logical AND operators, logical OR operators, and negations.
        The problem is to determine whether or not there exists an assignment
        for each terminal that allows the instance to evaluate to True.
        As seen in (Karp's 21 NP-Complete Problems), the satisfiability problem
        with at most 3 literals per clause is NP-Complete. This is the same 
        as the boolean satisfiability problem, but it is presented such that
        a clause contains exactly three terminals combined with logical OR operators
        and possbily negation, and each clause is combined with logical AND operators.
        The idea of NP-completeness shows that if one NP-complete problem can be solved
        in polynomial time, then all problems in the class NP can be solved in polynomial time.
        In other words, P = NP. In this paper I will show P = NP.
        
    \section{Standard Definitions}

    \begin{definition}
        Terminals: symbols used in the 3SAT problem that can be assigned a value
        of either 0 or 1, True or False, or any other binary assignment. They usually
        take the form $x_i$ where $i$ is a natural number.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Terms: terminals in either the positive or negated form that appear in a clause.
        If a term is positive, then the value of the terminal will be the 
        same as the value of the term. If a term is negated, then the value
        of the terminal will be the opposite of the value of the term.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Clauses: a set of terms combined by logical OR operators.
        Clauses usually take the form 
        $(x_i \lor \neg x_j \lor x_k)$ where $x_i \neq x_j \neq x_k$
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        (3SAT) Instance: a set of any number of clauses combined by logical
        AND operators. Terminals may not repeat within a clause
        \footnote{See Lemma 5.3}
        , but they are free to repeat between clauses. 
        Instances usually take the form:

        $(x_i \lor \neg x_j \lor x_k) \land (x_l \lor x_m \lor x_n)$
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Assignment: A list of values in which each value represents either True
        or False such that each item in the list corresponds to a terminal and 
        all terminals are assigned a value.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Satisfying Assignment: An assignment, $A$, is said to satisfy the instance, 
        if applying $A$ will make the instance evaluate to True.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Satisfiable: an instance is satisfiable iff there exists a satisfying assignment.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Unsatisfiable: an instance is unsatisfiable iff there does not exist a satisfying assignment.
    \end{definition}

    \section{Algorithm-Specific Definitions}
    \begin{definition}
        Blocking an Assignment: An assignment, $A$, is said to be blocked if, 
        given an instance containg the clause $C$, there is no way that $A$ can 
        satisfy the instance.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Implication: A clause, $C$, is said to imply another clause, $D$, if all 
        assignments blocked by $D$ are also blocked by $C$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Given Clauses: clauses which were given in the original instance.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Implied Clauses: clauses which are implied by the clauses in the original instance.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        k-terminal (k-t) clause: a clause is described as a k-terminal or a k-t clause
        if there are $k$ terminals in the clause.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Reduction: A special type of implication in which the implied 
        clause is shorter than the implying clause(s).
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Expansion: A special type of implication in which the 
        implied clause is longer than the implying clause(s).
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        Contradicting Clauses: A set of clauses is said to be contradicting if
        they block every assignment.
    \end{definition}

    \section{Reformatting}

    Since there are a lot of constant characteristics about an instance of 3SAT, 
    we can remove most of them to allow ourselves to focus only on what changes
    from instance to instance. A list of unchanging characteristics follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the symbol $x$
        \item logical AND operators
        \item logical OR operators
    \end{itemize}
    
    The only difference between instances, therefore, is the subscript of the terminal.
    
    Additionally, the following items will be changed to improve compatibility
    with Python code (cite python docs?) wherein an instance is expressed as
    a list of lists and each inner list represents a clause:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item parentheses will become square brackets
        \item negation symbols will become minus signs
        \item an instance may be surrounded with square brackets to show it is a list of lists
    \end{itemize}
   
    For example, the instance:
    
    $(\neg x_a \lor x_b \lor x_c) \land (x_a \lor x_d \lor x_e)$

    will be written as:

    $[[-a, b, c], [a, d, e]]$


    \section{Lemmas}

    \begin{lemma}
        A clause can block an assignment    
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Recall the definition of a clause blocking an assignment:
        An assignment is blocked if it does not allow the clause to evaluate to True.

        Since terms in a clause are combined by logical OR operators, a 
        clause cannot evalute to True iff all terms evalute to False.

        A term evaluates to False if it's either (1) negated and the terminal's
        value is True or (2) positive and the terminal's value is False

        Given a clause, we know there are three unique terminals and we can
        find assignments where all terms evalute to False.

        Since all the terms evaluate to False and are combined by logical OR operators, 
        the clause will evalutae to False.

        Since the instance is composed of clauses combined by logical AND operators 
        and one clause evalutes to False, then the entire instance evalutes to False.

        Since the instance evaluates to False, the assignment cannot satisfy
        the instance.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}        
        For a given instance with $n$ terminals, there are $2^n$ possible assignments.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        An assignment for this instance consists of $n$ values, each with two possible
        values, True or False.

        Therefore, there are $2^n$ possible assignments.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        If a clause contains the same terminal in its negated and positive form, it will
        not block any assignments.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}

        Consider a clause containing the same terminal in both the positive and
        negative form.

        We know that terminal must either be True or False. Consider both cases:

        That terminal's value is True:
        The positive form of the terminal will be True and the clause will evaluate to True.

        That terminal's value is False:
        The negated form of the terminal will be True and the clause will evaluate to True.

        Since the clause evaluates to True in every case, there will never be an 
        assignment with which it is impossible to make this clause evalute to False.
    \end{proof}

    % \begin{lemma}
    %     For a given instance with $n$ terminals, there are $8 * {\binom{n}{3}}$
    %     possible 3-terminal clauses that block at least one instance.
    % \end{lemma}
    % \begin{proof}
    %     Recall from Lemma XXX 3.2 that a clause containing the same terminal in both
    %     the positive and negated form will always be true.

    %     Therefore, it will never block any assignments.

    %     Recall also that an instance containing the same terminal in the same
    %     form twice is not a valid 3SAT clause.

    %     Therefore we do not have to consider clauses containing the same terminal
    %     twice since we are concerned with clauses that block assignments.

    %     Given an instance with $n$ terminals, choose three of them to make a clause
        
    %     Once the terminals are selected, each terminal can have one of two values, either
    %     True or False

    %     There are $2 * 2 * 2$ possible clauses based on these terminals

    %     Since there are $8$ clauses for every selection of three terminals, there are
    %     $8 * {\binom{n}{3}}$ possible clauses
    % \end{proof}

    % \begin{lemma}
    %     Each assignment can be blocked by at most ${\binom{n}{3}}$ 3-terminal clauses
    % \end{lemma}
    % \begin{proof}
    %     Consider an assignment, A. WTS it is blocked by ${\binom{n}{3}}$ clauses.

    %     Recall from Lemma XXX 3.4 that an assignment is blocked based on values of
    %     the three terminals in the clause blocking it.

    %     Notice also that each of these values only has one possible option since
    %     assignments have a fixed value for each terminal.

    %     Recall assignments are of length $n$.

    %     We can choose three of the $n$ values in the assignments to fix and
    %     make a clause out of it in the following manner:

    %     if the value is False, the term is positive

    %     if the value is True, the term is negated

    %     This will create a clause that blocks the assignment.

    %     This allows us to have ${\binom{n}{3}}$ possible clauses that block an assignment.
        
    % \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Each clause of length $k$ blocks $2^{n-k}$ assignments.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Consider the general k-terminal clause, $C$, in an instance with
        $n$ terminals.

        As seen in Lemma 5.1, this blocks all assignments where all of the terms
        evaluate to False.

        Since the values for $k$ terminals are set, there are $n-k$ terminals left
        whose values could be True or False.

        Since an assignment exists for every possible way to assign values to
        each terminal, we know an assignment exists for every possible way to
        assign a value for these $n-k$ terminals.

        There are two possible ways to assign values to each of these $n-k$ terminals
        so there are $2^{n-k}$ unique assignments blocked by $C$.
    \end{proof}

    % \begin{lemma}
    %     Adding clauses to an unsatisfiable instance will never make it satisfiable.
    %     Similarly, removing clauses from a satisfiable instance will never make it unsatisfiable.
    % \end{lemma}
    % \begin{proof}
    %     1. Recall that clauses block assignments and an instance is unsatisfiable if
    %     none of the possible assignments satisfy the instance, ie, an instnace is 
    %     unsatifiable if all of the assignments are blocked.

    %     Therefore, adding clauses to an instance in which all assignments are blocked
    %     will never be able to unblock an assignment and it will remain unsatisfiable.

    %     2. An instance is satisfiable if there exists a satisfying assignment, ie, 
    %     an instance is satisfiable if there is at least one assignment that's not blocked.

    %     Therefore, removing clauses will never be able to block that assignment and
    %     the instance will remain satisfiable.
    % \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        For any clause, $C$, if we select a terminal, $t$, that's not in $C$ 
        then half of the assignments
        blocked by $C$ will assign True to $t$ and the other half will assign 
        False to $t$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        We have a clause, $C$, of fixed yet arbitrary length:

        $[a, b, c, ...]$

        Now we select a terminal, $t$, that's not in $C$, say we call this
        terminal $t$.

        Want to show half of the assignments blocked by $C$ assign True to 
        $t$ and the other half assign False to $t$.

        We know there will be no overlap between these assignments because a single assignment
        cannot assign both the values True and False to the same terminal.

        Now we just have to show that exactly half of the assignments are blocked 
        by assigning either True or False to $t$.

        Let's say there are $k$ terms in C, then we know it blocks assignments 
        where all $k$ terms evaluate to False.

        By Lemma 5.4, this clause blocks $2^{n-k}$ assignments. 

        If we fix the value of $t$, then there are only $n-k-1$ terminals
        whose values could be 0 or 1. Since we have two choices per terminal
        and there are $n-k-1$ terminals, then there are $2^{n-k-1}$ assignments
        blocked by $C$ where the value of $t$ is fixed.

        Divide to get the ratio of the number of assignments blocked by adding 
        $t$ to the number of assignments blocked by $C$ without $t$:
        
        $2^{n-k-1}/2^{n-k}$

        = $2^{n - k - 1 - (n - k)}$

        = $2^{-1}$

        = $1/2$

        This shows that half of the assignments blocked by $C$ assign a fixed
        value to $t$.

        Since there are two possible values for $t$ and each block mutually
        exclusive halves of the assignments blocked by $C$, the lemma holds.

        For any clause, $C$, if we select a terminal, $t$, that's not
        in $C$ then half of the assignments blocked by $C$ will assign True
        to $t$ and the other half will assign False to $C$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Given a clause, $C$, and another clause, $D$, such that all of the 
        terms in $C$ also exist in $D$, then all of the assignments
        blocked by $D$ are also blocked by $C$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Given a clause, $C$, of a fixed yet arbitrary length:

        $[a, b, c, ...]$

        And another clause, $D$, containing all the terms in $C$ with possibly
        additional terms:

        $[a, b, c, ..., d, e, f, ...]$

        Want to show all the assignments blocked by $D$ are also blocked by $C$.

        We know that $C$ blocks all assignments that cause all the terms to evaluate
        to False.

        In other words, $C$ blocks all assignments where 
 
        $a = b = c = ... = False$

        Similarly, $D$ blocks all assignments where

        $a = b = c = ... = d = e = f = ... = False$

        Clearly all assignments consistent with the terminal assignments from $D$
        are also consistent with the terminal assignments from $C$.

        Therefore, every assignment blocked by $D$ is also blocked by $C$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}[Reduction]
        Given the following conditions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $A$ is a clause of length $k$
            \item $B$ is a clause of length $k$
            \item $A$ and $B$ share $k-1$ identical terms
            \item $A$ and $B$ share one terminal that is negated in one clause
            and positive in the other
            \item $C$ is a clause of length $k-1$ composed of the shared terms
            from $A$ and $B$
        \end{itemize}
        Then $A$ and $B$ imply $C$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Given clauses consistent with the description:

        $A := [a, b, c, ... i]$

        $B := [a, b, c, ..., -i]$

        where $a, b, c, ...$ is shared between the clauses and $i$ is a 
        terminal not in $a, b, c, ...$

        Want to show this implies the described clause.

        Recall by Lemma 5.3 that the same terminal cannot appear both negated and
        positive within the same
        clause and still block an assignment, so $i$ cannot exist in $a, b, c...$

        Consider the clause

        $C := [a, b, c, ...]$

        We know by Lemma 5.5 that if we select a terminal that's not in $C$, say $t$, 
        then half of the assignments blocked by $C$ assign True to $t$ and the other
        half of the assignments blocked by $C$ assign False to $t$.

        Let this terminal $t$ that's not in $C$ be the terminal $i$ that's in $A$ and $B$.

        We know that $A$ blocks all assignments blocked by $C$ where $i$ is assigned
        the value of False.

        We know that $B$ blocks all assignments blocked by $C$ where $i$ is assigned
        the value of True.

        Since $A$ and $B$ both block mutually exclusive halves of the assignments
        blocked by $C$, we can say that $A$ and $B$ imply $C$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}[Expansion]
        Given a clause, $C$, and a terminal, $t$, that's not in $C$, two 
        new clauses can be implied consisting of all the terms of $C$ 
        appended to either the positive form of $t$ or the negated form of $t$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Given a clause, $C$, and a terminal, $t$, that's not in $C$:

        $C := [a, b, c, ...]$

        We can compose two new clauses:

        $D := [a, b, c, ..., t]$

        $E := [a, b, c, ..., -t]$

        Since D and E both contain all the terminals from C, by Lemma 5.6 then
        D and E are implied by C.
        
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}[General Lemma 5.7]
        If two clauses share the same terminal, $t$, such that $t$ is 
        positive in one clause and negated in the other, then these clauses 
        imply a new clause which is composed of all the terms in both clauses 
        that do not have $t$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Consider two clauses, 

        $C := [a, b, c, ..., t]$
        
        $D := [d, e, f, ..., -t]$

        Where within a clause, the same terminal does not repeat, but between
        clauses the same terminal may repeat.

        Want to show we can imply a clause consistent with the lemma description:

        $E := [a, b, c, ..., d, e, f, ...]$

        Let's define some additional clauses:

        $E' := [a, b, c, ..., d, e, f, ..., t]$

        $E'' := [a, b, c, ..., d, e, f, ..., -t]$

        By Lemma 5.6, we know that $C$ implies $E'$, ie, all assignments blocked by
        $C$ are also blocked by $E'$.

        By Lemma 5.6, we know that $D$ implies $E''$.

        By Lemma 5.7, since $E'$ and $E''$ share all the same terms except 
        for $t$, which is positive in one clause and negated in the other, 
        we can create a new clause composed of all the shared terms in $E'$ 
        and $E''$.

        Such a clause is already defined as $E$.

        Now there are a couple extra cases to consider:
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item There is some overlap between a, b, c, ... and d, e, f, ...
            \item There is the same terminal that's positive in a, b, c, ...
            and negated in d, e, f, ...
        \end{itemize}

        First, if the same term exists in a, b, c, ... and d, e, f, ..., then we
        can just remove one of the duplicates since one term being true implies an identical term being True

        Secondly, if the same terminal exists, but is of the opposite form in a, b, c, ... and d, e, f, ...
        then by Lemma 5.3, this clause will always be True and thus blocks no assignments. In this case, 
        we can disregard $E$ since it is of no value.
        
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Given two clauses of lengths $k$ and $m$ that share a terminal, $t$, which is 
        positive in one clause and negated in the other, you will be able
        to directly imply clauses of length $max(k, m)-1$ to $(k + m - 2)$ where
        the function $max(a, b)$ represents the parameter with the greatest value.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        The smallest clause that can be implied by clauses of length $k$ and $m$
        using Lemma 3.9 occur when all but one of the terms in one clause exist in the other.

        As such, the unique terms will come from the clause that's longer.

        Removing $t$, you are left with 1 less than the maximum of $k$ and $m$.

        The largest clause can be implied if there are no terms shared between
        the two clauses. In this case you subtract $1$ from the length of each
        clause to account for $t$ and since no duplicates will be removed, the 
        resulting clause's length is $2$ less than the sum of the lengths of 
        the clauses.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Given four clauses of length k - 1, A, B, C, and D, and one clause of 
        length k, E, such that 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A and B imply E
            \item C and E imply D
        \end{itemize}
        Then A, B, and C, imply D without having to process a clause of length k
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        
        In the following figure, the first graph shows the implications as described, the second
        graph shows the implications we want to prove:
        
        \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{317a}

        % add label to figure

        Define the clauses in the following manner:

        A := [a, b, $\beta$, i]

        B := [c, d, $\delta$ -i]

        C := [-a, e, f, $\phi$]

        Then the following are derived by Lemma 5.9:
        
        $\rightarrow$ E = [a, b, $\beta$, c, d, $\delta$]

        $\rightarrow$ D = [b, $\beta$, c, d, $\delta$, e, f, $\phi$]

        $\rightarrow$ F = [b, $\beta$, i, e, f, $\phi$]

        Where $\beta, \delta, $ and $\phi$ are generic sets of terms in the instance.

        Note that since $C$ and $E$ imply $D$, then $C$ and $E$ must share the
        same terminal such that it is positive in one clause and negated in the other.
        Since all of the terms in $E$ came from $A$ or $B$ (not including $i$),
        then such a term in $C$ must have the same term of the opposite form in
        $A$ or $B$ (again it cannot be $i$ since $i$ is not in $E$). And since
        $A$ and $B$ are fixed yet arbitrary sets, it does not matter which clause
        we pick as long as it is fixed for the rest of the proof. Let's pick a
        the terminal, $a$, from clause $A$. Now $C$ must contain $-a$.
 
        Recall from Lemma 5.3 that if a clause blocks any assignments, it cannot
        contain the same term in both forms, so if $\beta, \delta$, or $\phi$ contain
        the same terminal in both forms then $D$ blocks no assignments and the resulting
        clause may be disregarded.

        We know $C$ is of length $k$ and $D$ is of length $k - 1$ or $k$.

        In the following equations, let the presence of a term represent a count of one,
        and the presence of a set of terms represent the number of terms in that set. If
        multiple sets of terms are shown in parentheses, let this represent the number
        of terms found in both sets.

        Consider the case where $D$ has length $k$ then we can define $k$ in terms of $D$:
        
        $k = b + c + d + e + f + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) - 
        (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        length of $F = b + i + e + f + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi)$

        Want to show length of $F$ is less than $k$

        $b + i + e + f + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi) < 
        b + c + d + e + f + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) - 
        (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        $\rightarrow$ $i + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi) < 
        c + d + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) - 
        (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        $\rightarrow$ $i < 
        c + d + \delta - (\beta \delta) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        As seen by using a Venn Diagram or other set intuition, $\delta - 
        (\beta \delta) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$, 
        represents the number of terminals in $\delta$ not in $\beta$
        and not in $\phi$.

        The lowest case for the right hand side of the inequality is where 
        this is 0, ie, all of the terms in $\delta$ are in $\beta$ or 
        $\phi$. In this case, the inequality becomes:

        $\rightarrow$ $i < c + d$

        Which is true as long as $c$ and $d$ exist in $B$.

        WTS $c$ and $d$ always exists in $B$:

        Suppose not, then 

        $B := [\delta, -i]$

        Notice that $\delta$ is simply a fixed, yet arbitrary set of terms
        following the rules of a valid clause.

        As long as $\delta$ contains at least two terms, we can simply use 
        any two terms from $\delta$ as c and d.

        If $\delta$ does not contain two terms, then the largest possible
        length of B is 2.
        
        By Lemma 5.10, the largest clause this can imply is of length 
        $(a + b - 2)$ where $a$ is the length of $A$ and $b$ is the length 
        of $B$.

        This means the largest $E$ implied by $A$ and $B$ has the same 
        length as $A$.

        Because the lengths are equal, such a case would not allow $A$ to 
        have length $k - 1$ and $E$ to have length $k$.

        Such a case would be inconsistent with the conditions of this 
        lemma and would not apply.
        
        Therefore, at least two terms have to exist in \{$c, d$\}

        Since $c$ and $d$ always exist in $B$, you can derive $D$ by processing
        clauses of length at most $k-1$.
    
        Consider the case where the length of $D$ is $k - 1$:

        This means $k$ is one greater than the length of $D$, so $k$ is now:

        $k = b + c + d + e + f + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) - 
        (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi) + 1$

        Similarly as before, the inequality will become:

        $\rightarrow$ $i < c + d + 1$

        Which is again true as long as $c$ and $d$ are in $B$ and $i$ is in $A$.

        Similarly to the first half of this proof, $c$ and $d$ have to be in
        $B$.

        $i$ has to be in $A$ by the conditions of this lemma.

        Since the length of $F$ is less than $k$ in all cases, you can derive
        $D$ by processing only clauses with a maximum length of $k-1$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Given the following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $A$ is a clause of length less than $k$
            \item $B$ is a clause of length $k$
            \item $C$ is a clause of length less than $k$
            \item $D$ is a clause of length $k$ or $k - 1$
            \item $A$ expands to imply $B$ by Lemma 5.8
            \item $B$ and $C$ imply $D$ by Lemma 5.9
        \end{itemize}
        Then $A$ and $C$ can imply $D$ by processing clauses of at 
        most length $k - 1$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}

        Consider the following case:

        \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{318}

        A := [a, b, $\beta$]
        
        A' := [a, b, $\beta$, c]

        B := [a, b, $\beta$, c, d, $\delta$]

        $C_1$ := [-a, e, f, $\phi$]

        $C_2$ := [-c, e, f, $\phi$]

        $D_1$ := [b, $\beta$, c, d, $\delta$, e, f, $\phi$]

        $D_2$ := [a, b, $\beta$, d, $\delta$, e, f, $\phi$]

        E := [b, $\beta$, e, f, $\phi$]

        F := [a, b, $\beta$, e, f, $\phi$]

        Where $\beta, \delta$, and $\phi$ are fixed, yet arbitrary sets of terms 
        abiding by the rules for a valid clause (see Lemma 5.3) and consistent
        with the conditions of this lemma.

        Notice that $C$ has to contain a term from $B$ in the opposite form by 
        lemma 5.9.

        Notice that $B$ is made up of terms from $A$ and terms not in $A$
        by lemma 5.6.

        The term in $C$ which is opposite from the term in $B$ can therefore
        be opposite (1) from a term
        in $A$ (in this case, use $C_1$ and $D_1$) or (2) a 
        term not in $A$ (in this case use $C_2$ and $D_2$).
        
        (1) Consider the opposite form term in $C$ is in $A$, ie, use $C_1$
        and $D_1$:

        Notice $A$ and $C_1$ share an opposite term, then they can derive
        a clause, $E$, by Lemma 5.9. And $E$ can imply a clause $D_1$ by Lemma 5.8:

        \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{318b.png}

        % label the graphic

        Want to show you only have to process clauses whose length is
        less than $k$ to derive $D_1$.

        Want to show length of $E$ is less than $k$.

        Consider two cases: (1a) $D$ is of length $k$ and 
        (1b) $D$ is of length $k - 1$
        
        Consider (1a) where $D$ is of length $k$:

        In the following equations, let the presence of a term represent a count of one,
        and the presence of a set of terms represent the number of terms in that set. If
        multiple sets of terms are shown in parentheses, let this represent the number
        of terms found in both sets.

        Since $D$ is of length $k$, we can define $k$ as follows:

        $k = b + c + d + e + f + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) 
        - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        Length of $E = b + e + f + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi)$
        
        Want to show the length of $E$ is less than $k$:

        $b + e + f + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi) < b + c + d + e + f + 
        \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) 
        + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        $\rightarrow 0 < c + d + \delta - (\beta \delta) 
        - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        Using a Venn Diagram or by other set intuition, $\delta - 
        (\beta \delta) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$ represents
        the number of terms in $\delta$ not in $\beta$ and not in $\phi$. 
        The lowest this value can be is 0 if all terms in $\delta$ are in 
        $\beta$ or $\phi$.

        The inequality becomes:

        $\rightarrow 0 < c + d$

        Which is true as long as $c$ or $d$ exist in $B$.

        WTS $c$ or $d$ always exists in $B$.

        Suppose not, then:

        $B := [a, b, \beta]$

        Note that the maximum length of $\delta$ is 0 because if it were 1
        or more, then we can just extract $c$ or $d$ from $\delta$.

        In this case, the length of $B$ is the same as the length of $A$ and 
        it is impossible for the lemma conditions defining the lengths
        of $A$ and $B$ to be true.

        Therefore, $c$ or $d$ must always exist in $B$.

        Since $c$ or $d$ must exist in $B$, the inequality is always true, 
        and the length of $E$ is indeed less than $k$.

        Consider (1b) $D$ is of length $k - 1$:

        Then the length of $k$ is redefined as:

        $k = b + c + d + e + f + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) 
        - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi) + 1$

        Similarly as before, the inequality becomes:

        $\rightarrow 0 < c + d + 1$

        Which is always true so the length of $E$ is indeed less than $k$.

        Notice that, by lemma 5.8, you only have to process clauses of length
        at most $k-1$ to derive a clause of length $k$, in context, you 
        can derive $D$ via expansion while only processing clauses with
        a maximum length of $k-1$.

        % rephrase
        % Since expanding a clause only directly implies clauses of length 1 greater, 
        % you only have to process clauses of at most length k - 1 to derive D

        (2) Consider the case using $C_2$ and $D_2$:

        We can construct a clause, $A'$, such that $A$ expands to $A'$ by 
        lemma 5.8 and there is a term in $A'$ whose opposite term is in $C_2$.

        By lemma 5.9, $A'$ and $C_2$ imply a clause, $F$.

        And by lemma 5.6, all the terms in $F$ are in $D_2$ so $F$ implies $D_2$.

        This is seen in the following figure:

        \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{318c.png}
        
        Want to show (2a) $A'$ and (2b) $F$ are shorter than $k$.

        First, Want to show the length of $A'$ is less than $k$:

        Consider two cases, (2ai) $D_2$ is of length $k$ and 
        (2aii) $D_2$ is of length k - 1

        Consider (2ai) $D_2$ is of length $k$, then we can define k as follows:

        $k = b + c + d + e + f + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) 
        - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        length of $A' = a + b + \beta + c$

        Want to show the length of $A'$ is less than $k$:

        $\rightarrow$ $a + b + \beta + c$ $<$ $b + c + d + e + f + 
        \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) 
        - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        $\rightarrow$ $a$ $<$ $d + e + f + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) 
        - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        By Venn Diagram or other set intuition, 
        $\delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + 
        (\beta \delta \phi)$ represents the number of unique terms in 
        $\delta$ and $\phi$.
        The smallest value for this is when $\delta = \phi$, so this can
        be replaced with $\phi$.

        $\rightarrow$ $a$ $<$ $d + e + f + \phi$

        Which is clearly true as long as there are at least two terms in $d, e, f, \delta$ or $\phi$.

        Consider the cases where 0 terms exist in $d, e, f, \delta, \phi$

        Then 
        
        $D_2 := [a, b, \beta]$

        Recall 

        $A := [a, b, \beta]$

        It is seen $A$ and $D_2$ are the same length, but the conditions of the lemma state
        $A$ is of length less than $k$ and $D$ is of length $k$. 

        This is a contradiction so at least one term has to exist in $d, e, f, \delta, \phi$

        Consider the cases where 1 term exists in $d, e, f, \delta, \phi$

        Then 
        
        $D_2 := [a, b, \beta, x]$

        Where $x$ is a single term from $\{d, e, f, \delta, \phi\}$
        
        Recall $A = [a, b, \beta]$

        Since $x$ is exactly one term, $D_2$ is larger than $A$.

        The clause $A$ can expand to $D_2$ by Lemma 5.6. In this case, 
        we can expand $A$ to $D_2$ directly and we do not necessarily 
        need $A'$,
        
        Since $D_2$ is of length $k$, it can be expanded to by processing
        only clauses with a maximum length of $k-1$.

        Therefore, either the inequality holds, or if it doesn't we can
        derive $D_2$ directly without processing clauses longer than length $k-1$.

        Consider (2aii) $D_2$ is of length $k - 1$:

        $k$ is now defined as:

        $k = b + c + d + e + f + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) 
        - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi) + 1$

        Similarly as before, the inequality becomes:

        $\rightarrow$ $a$ $<$ $d + e + f + \phi + 1$

        Where $\phi$ = $\delta$

        Which is true as long as there is at least one term in
        $d, e, f, \delta$ or $\phi$.

        As seen before, if there are fewer than two terms in
        $\{d, e, f, \delta, \phi\}$ then we can derive $D_2$ without
        processing clauses larger than length $k-1$.

        Therefore if $D_2$ is of length $k - 1$, the length of $A'$ is 
        shorter than $k$.
        
        (2b) want to show $F$ is shorter than $k$.

        Consider two cases, (2bi) $D_2$ is of length $k$ and 
        (2bii) $D_2$ is of length $k - 1$.

        Consider (2bi) where $D_2$ is of length $k$:
        
        By $D_2$, $k$ is defined as 

        $k = b + c + d + e + f + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) 
        - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        length of $F = a + b + e + f + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi)$
        
        WTS length of $F$ is less than $k$:

        $a + b + e + f + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi)$ $<$ 
        $b + c + d + e + f + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) 
        - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        $\rightarrow$ $a$ $<$ $c + d + \delta - (\beta \delta) - 
        (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$

        Using a Venn Diagram or by other set intuition, 
        $\delta - (\beta \delta) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi)$
        represents the terms in $\delta$ that are not in $\beta$ or $\phi$.
        
        This is lowest when all the terms in $\delta$ are in $\beta$ or $\phi$, 
        this part of the inequality then becomes 0.

        Then the inequality becomes:

        $\rightarrow$ $a$ $<$ $c + d$

        Which is clearly true if $c$ and $d$ exist.

        Consider the case where $c$ and $d$ don't exist.

        Then $B$ can be redefined:

        $B := [a, b, \beta, x]$

        where $x$ is a single term. Note that if $x$ is more than one term,
        then we could use the two terms in $x$ as $c$ and $d$.

        Here we can use $x$ as $c$ and $B$ becomes equivalent to $A'$, 
        which was already shown to be shorter than $k$ or irrelevant
        as $D_2$ could be derived directly from $A$ without processing
        clauses of length greater than $k-1$.

        Consider (2bii) where $D_2$ is of length $k - 1$.

        Then $k$ is defined as:

        $k = b + c + d + e + f + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) 
        - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi) + 1$

        Want to show length of $F$ is less than $k$:

        $a + b + e + f + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi)$ $<$ 
        $b + c + d + e + f + \beta + \delta + \phi - (\beta \delta) 
        - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \phi) + 1$

        Similarly as before, this becomes:

        $\rightarrow$ $a$ $<$ $c + d + 1$

        Which is always true since we already proved $c$ and $d$ have to exist
        or if they don't we can derive $D_2$ without processing clauses
        greater than length $k-1$. 

        Since the cases where we cannot directly derive $D_2$ by processing
        clauses with a maximum length of $k-1$ imply the inequality holds, then
        $F$ is smaller than $k$ and $D_2$ has a maximum length of $k$, 
        and by Lemma 3.6 the largest a clause has to be in order to imply
        another clause of length $k$ is $k-1$. Meaning you only have to process
        clauses of length $k-1$ in order to derive a clause of length $k$.
        
        Since $A, C_1, C_2, E,$ and $F$ are all shorter than $k$ or
        $D$ can be directly derived from clauses shorter than $k$ 
        and $D$ can
        be derived by expanding $E$ or $F$, then $D$ can be derived from $A$
        and/or $C$ without the need to process clauses of length greater than $k - 1$.
    \end{proof}

    % \begin{lemma}
    %     Using Lemma 5.10, a 1-t clause can only be directly implied by two 2-t clauses sharing
    %     the same terminal with the other terminal positive in one clause and 
    %     negated in the other.
    % \end{lemma}
    % \begin{proof}
    %     Given a 1-t clause, 
        
    %     [i]

    %     WTS that it can only be directly implied by 2-t clauses like 

    %     [i, j]

    %     [i, -j]

    %     By Lemma XXX 3.13, the smallest clause that can be derived from two
    %     clauses of length k and l is max(k, l) - 1.

    %     With k = l = 2, this gives us a clause of length 1.

    %     If we increase by the lowest possible amount, say k = 3, l = 2, this
    %     gives us a clause of length 2.

    %     So we have to use two clauses of length 2 if we want to directly imply
    %     a clause of length 1 by using the algorithm.

    %     By the algorithm, both clauses must share the same terminal, where it's 
    %     positive in one clause and negative in the other.

    %     Now each clause has one remaining terminal and they could either be (1)
    %     the same terminal or (2) different terminals.

    %     \begin{enumerate}
    %         \item The same term:
            
    %         By Lemma XXX 3.12 or more directly Lemma XXX 3.10, this will derive a 1-t clause
            
    %         \item Different term:
            
    %         By Lemma XXX 3.12, this will derive a 2-t clause
    %     \end{enumerate}

    %     Therefore, using Lemma XXX 3.12, a 1-t clause can only be directly implied by 
    %     two 2-t clauses sharing the same terminal with the other terminal positive
    %     in one clause and negated in the other.

    \begin{lemma}
        Given an instance of 3SAT, you can expand all of the given clauses
        to the point where you are considering clauses of length $n$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Given an instance of 3SAT, we know all clauses are of length 3.

        If we want to consider a generic $n$-terminal, $B$, that's implied by a
        given clause, $A$, then by Lemma 5.6 we know it's implied iff it $B$ 
        contains all of the terms in $A$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        If you expand given 3-t clauses as described in Lemma 5.13, you will
        derive $2^n$ unique clauses of length $n$ iff the instance is unsatisfiable.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Want to show an unsatifiable instance $\implies$ $2^n$ unique n-terminal
        clauses can be derived from the given 3-t clauses:

        By lemma 5.4, a clause of length $n$ blocks 1 assignment. 

        Recall an instance is unsatisfiable iff all $2^n$ assignments are
        blocked.

        If a 3-terminal clause blocks an assignment, then it also implies
        the corresponding n-terminal assignment because there is one possible
        n-terminal clause for any assignment.

        Since all assignments are blocked, there exists a 3-terminal clause for each
        assignment such that the terminals in the clause are assigned to make
        the clause evalute to false.

        Similarly, for each assignment, there exists an n-terminal clause such
        that the terminals in the clause are assigned to make the clause evaluate
        to false.

        This will create a unique n-terminal clause for each assignment since
        each clause can block only one assignment and overlap would imply
        the same terminal having two values in the same assignment.

        Notice that for each of these n-terminal clauses, they must contain
        three terms from at least one given clause. If they didn't, then
        the assignment blocked by that n-terminal clause would not be blocked
        and the instance would be satisfiable.

        Want to show $2^n$ unique n-terminal clauses are derived by the given
        3-t clauses $\implies$ then the instance is unsatifiable.

        By lemma 5.4, a clause of length $n$ blocks 1 assignment. 

        Therefore if there are $2^n$ unique n-terminal clauses, then
        all $2^n$ assignments will be blocked.

        Note that there will be no overlap because each n-terminal clause
        sets the value for each terminal and overlap would imply a terminal
        having two values at the same time.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        The n-terminal clauses described in Lemma 5.14 can be reduced to derive
        any pair of contradicting 1-terminal clauses.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Given $2^n$ n-terminal clauses, want to show you can imply any pair
        of contradicting 1-terminal clauses by lemma 5.7.

        Pick a terminal that will not exist in the final 1-terminal clauses.

        Half of the existing n-terminal clauses have that terminal assigned
        the value of False and the other half have that terminal assigned
        the value of True.

        Pick one clause that blocks an assignment where the terminal is True.

        Then there exists an assignment for each possible
        value for the remaining n-1 terminals.

        Therefore, there must exist another clause that shares all of the same terms, but
        where that one terminal is assigned the value of False.

        Using these two terms, we can create a new clause by lemma 5.7.

        Now all of the clauses of length n - 1 do not contain that terminal.

        Repeat this process while never selecting the same terminal twice
        until you are left with two contradicting 1-terminal clauses.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Contradicting 1-terminal clauses can be expanded to imply
        every possible clause.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let the following clauses be a pair of contradicting 1-t clauses:

        [a]

        [-a]

        By lemma 5.6, we can expand to any clause that contains $a$ or $-a$.

        Let the following be a generic 3-terminal clause that does not contain
        $a$ or $-a$:

        [b, c, d, ...]

        By Lemma 5.6, we know the 1-terminal clauses imply the following 3-t clauses:

        [a, b]

        [-a, c, d, ...]

        By Lemma 5.9, these clauses imply:

        [b, c, d, ...]
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Given the following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A, B, C, and D, are clauses shorter than k
            \item E and F are clauses of length k
            \item G is a clause of length k or k - 1
            \item A and B imply E
            \item C and D imply F
            \item E and F imply G
        \end{itemize}
        Then G can be implied by processing clauses with a maximum length of k - 1
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        The described clauses have been displayed in a graph for an easier understanding:

        \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{517a.png}

        Let the clauses be defined as follows:

        $A := [a, b, \beta, i]$

        $B := [c, d, \delta, -i]$
        
        $C := [-a, f, \phi, j]$
        
        $D := [g, h, \gamma, -j]$

        Then the following are implied by Lemma 5.9:

        $E = [a, b, \beta, c, d, \delta]$
        
        $F = [-a, f, \phi, g, h, \gamma]$
        
        $G = [b, \beta, c, d, \delta, f, \phi, g, h, \gamma]$
        
        Where $\beta, \delta, \phi,$ and $\gamma$ are fixed yet arbitrary sets
        of terms consistent with the rules for a valid clause as by Lemma 5.3.

        Notice that $E$ and $F$ have to share a term of the opposite form
        in order to imply $G$ by Lemma 5.9. Since $A, B, C,$ and $D$ are
        all arbitrary clauses, selecting which term to negate does not
        have an effect on the outcome. Here the opposite term is shared 
        between $A$ and $D$, but any term that appears positive in $A$
        or $B$ and negated in $C$ or $D$ will yield the same results.
 
        Want to show $G$ can be derived by processing clauses with a 
        maximum length of k - 1.

        Define additional implications:

        $H = [b, \beta, i, f, \phi, j]$ (By clauses $A$ and $C$)

        $I = [c, d, \delta, b, \beta, f, \phi, j]$ (By clauses $B$ and $H$)

        $J = [g, h, \gamma, c, d, \delta, b, \beta, f, \phi]$ (By clauses $D$ and $I$)

        Notice $J$ is equivalent to $G$.

        Want to show (1) $H$ is shorter than $k$ and (2) $I$ is shorter than $k$

        (1) Want to show $H$ is shorter than $k$

        Two cases to consider (1a) $G$ is of length $k$ and (1b) $G$ is of length $k - 1$

        (1a) $G$ is of length $k$

        In the following equations, let the presence of a term represent a count of one,
        and the presence of a set of terms represent the number of terms in that set. If
        multiple sets of terms are shown in parentheses, let this represent the number
        of terms found in both sets.

        Since $G$ is of length $k$ we can define $k$ as follows:

        $k = b + c + d + f + g + h
            + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
            - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) -(\phi \gamma)
            + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
            - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        $

        Length of $H = b + i + f + j + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi)$
        
        Want to show the length of $H$ is less than $k$:

        $b + i + f + j + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi)$
        $<$
        $b + c + d + f + g + h
            + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
            - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) -(\phi \gamma)
            + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
            - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        $

        $\rightarrow$
        $i + j$
        $<$
        $c + d + g + h
            + \delta + \gamma
            - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) -(\phi \gamma)
            + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
            - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        $

        The R.H.S. has the following set intuition:

            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

        As seen above, the R.H.S. is left with the following terms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item terms just in $\delta$
            \item terms just in $\gamma$
            \item terms in both $\delta$ and $\gamma$
        \end{itemize}
        
        The lowest possible value for this is 0 when the three aforementioned sets
        have no terms.

        The inequality becomes:

        $b + i + f + j < b + c + d + f + g + h$

        $\rightarrow$ $i + j < c + d + g + h$

        Which requires at least three unique terms in $c, d, g,$ and $h$.

        Want to show at least three unique terms have to exist in 
        $c, d, g,$ and $h$.

        Suppose not. Then at most two unique terms exist in $c, d, g,$ and $h$.

        Want to show the length of either E or F is the same as A, B, C, or D.

        Consider all cases where there are fewer than three terms in {$c, d, g, h$}

        Case 1, 0 terms exist in {$c, d, g, h$}

        Recall the value for $B$

        $B := [c, d, \delta, -i]$

        But since 0 terms exist in {$c, d, g, h$}, this becomes

        $B := [-i]$

        Note that no terms may exist in $\delta$ because any terms
        in $\delta$ could be extracted to count as $c$ or $d$.

        Then a new derivation of $E$ occurs:

        $E := [a, b, \beta]$

        Which is identical to $A$ except for a missing $i$ terminal.

        Therefore the length of $E$ is less than the length of $A$.

        This is a contradiction since the length of $E$ is given as $k$
        and the length of $A$ is given as less than $k$.

        Therefore this case is impossible.

        Case 2, 1 term exists in {$c, d, g, h$}

        It was shown that if 0 terms exist in {$c, d$}, there's a contradiction, 
        so at least one term has to exist in {$c, d$}.

        These terms are fixed, yet arbitrary so let's pick $c$ to be the one term that exists.

        $B$ is now assigned:

        $B := [c, -i]$

        Again, no additional terms may exist in $\delta$ since they could
        be used as the terminal $d$.

        $E$ is again recalculated as:

        $E := [a, b, \beta, c]$

        By Lemma 5.10, the maximum length of E is 
        (length of $A$ + length of $B$ - 2).

        Since exactly one term exists in $c$ and exactly one term exists in $-i$,
        the length of $B$ is 2 and therefore the length of $E$ is the same
        as the length of $A$.

        However it was given that the length of $E$ is $k$ and the length of 
        $A$ is less than $k$.

        This is a contradiction so this case cannot exist.

        Case 3, 2 terms exist in {$c, d, g, h$}

        As seen in Case 2, at least two terms must exist in {$c, d$}. This
        leaves one term for {$g, h$}. These are fixed yet arbitrary terms
        so it does not matter which term we select to exist. Let's pick
        $g$.

        The clause $D$ can be rewritten:

        $D := [g, -j]$

        Note that $\gamma$ cannot contain any terms because any terms in
        $\gamma$ could be extracted and used as $h$.

        Similarly as above, the length of $D$ is 2.

        Now the maximum length of $F$ is (length of $C$ + length of $D$ - 2).
        Which means the maximum length of $F$ is the same as the length of $C$.

        However it was given that the length of $F$ is $k$ and the length
        of $C$ is less than $k$.

        This is a contradiction so this case cannot exist.

        Since at least three terms must exist in {$c, d, g, h$}, the
        inequality holds and $H$ is shorter than $k$.

        (1b) $G$ is of length $k - 1$

        If $G$ is of length $k - 1$, then k is defined as:

        $k = b + c + d + f + g + h
            + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
            - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) -(\phi \gamma)
            + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
            - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
            + 1
        $

        Similarly to before, the inequality becomes:

        $\rightarrow$ $i + j < c + d + g + h + 1$

        Which is true as long as at least two terms exist in {$c, d, g, h$}.

        We already showed at least three terms must exist in {$c, d, g, h$}
        so the inequality is always true.

        Therefore $H$ is always shorter than $k$. 

        (2) Want to show $I$ is shorter than $k$

        Two cases to consider (2a) $G$ is of length $k$ and (2b) $G$ is of length $k - 1$

        (2a) $G$ is of length $k$

        Since $G$ is of length $k$ we can define $k$ as follows:

        $k = b + c + d + f + g + h
            + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
            - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) -(\phi \gamma)
            + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
            - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        $

        Length of $I = c + d + b + f + j
        + \delta + \beta + \phi
        - (\delta \beta) - (\delta \phi) - (\beta \phi)
        + (\delta \beta \phi)
        $

        Want to show the length of $I$ is less than $k$:

        $c + d + b + f + j
        + \delta + \beta + \phi
        - (\delta \beta) - (\delta \phi) - (\beta \phi)
        + (\delta \beta \phi)
        $
        $<$
        $b + c + d + f + g + h
            + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
            - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) -(\phi \gamma)
            + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
            - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        $

        By Venn Diagram or other set intuition, 
        the generic sets of terms on the L.H.S. represent the number 
        of unique terms in $\delta, \beta,$ and $\phi$. Similarly, 
        the generic sets of terms on the R.H.S. represent the number
        of unique terms in $\delta, \beta, \phi,$ and $\gamma$.

        Subtacting the shared sets of terms from both sides, on
        the R.H.S. we are left
        with the terms in $\gamma$ that are not present in 
        $\delta, \beta, or \phi$. The lowest value for this is 0 when
        all terms in $\gamma$ exist in $\delta, \beta,$ and $\phi$.

        The inequality therefore becomes:

        $c + d + b + f + j < b + c + d + f + g + h$

        $\rightarrow j < g + h$

        Which is true as long as both g and h exist.

        Want to show g and h exist.

        Suppose not, then g and h don't exist.

        Recall the value for $D$:

        $D := [g, h, \gamma, -j]$

        Since $g$ and $h$ don't exist, this becomes

        $D := [-j]$

        Note that not terms may exist in $\gamma$ because any terms in $\gamma$
        could be extracted and counted as $g$ or $h$.

        Now we recalculate $E$:

        $E := [-a, f, \phi]$

        Which is smaller than $C$ because $j$ has to exist by the lemma's conditions.

        However it was given that the length of $E$ is $k$ and the length of $C$
        is less than $k$.

        This is a contradiction, therefore $g$ and $h$ must exist.

        Therefore the inequality is always true.

        (2b) $G$ is of length $k - 1$

        Similarly as before, we define k in terms of the length of G:

        $k = b + c + d + f + g + h
            + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
            - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) -(\phi \gamma)
            + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
            - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
            + 1
        $

        Similarly to before, the inequality becomes
        
        $\rightarrow j < g + h + 1$

        Which is true as long as $g$ and $h$ exist. 

        We already showed $g$ and $h$ exist so the inequality always 
        holds true.

        Therefore, the length of $I$ is at most $k - 1$.

        Since we can derive J (which is equivalent to G) by processing
        A, B, C, D, H, and I, all of which whose lengths are shorter than k, 
        we can derive G by only processing clauses whose lengths are 
        less than k.
        
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Given the following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item a clause, $A$, of length less than $k$
            \item a clause, $B$, of length less than $k$
            \item a clause, $C$, of length less than $k$
            \item a clause, $D$, of length $k$
            \item a clause $E$, of length $k$
            \item a clause $F$, of length $k - 1$
            \item A and B imply D by Lemma 5.9
            \item C expands to E by Lemma 5.8
            \item D and E imply F by Lemma 5.9
        \end{itemize}
        Then F can be implied by only processing clauses with a maximum
        length of $k-1$
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        The following graphic depicts the described clauses:

        \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{518a}

        Let the following clauses be defined:

        $A := [a, b, \beta, i]$

        $B := [c, d, \delta, -i]$

        $C_1 := [-a, f, \phi]$
        
        $C_2 := [e, f, \phi]$
        
        Then the following clauses are implied:
        
        $D = [a, b, \beta, c, d, \delta]$
        
        $E_1 = [-a, f, \phi, g, h, \gamma]$
        
        $E_2 = [e, f, \phi, -a, h, \gamma]$
        
        $F_1 = [b, \beta, c, d, \delta, f, \phi, g, h, \gamma]$
        
        $F_2 = [b, \beta, c, d, \delta, e, f, \phi, h, \gamma]$
        
        Where $\beta, \delta, \phi$ and $\gamma$ are generic sets of terms
        such that A, B, and C block at least one clause by Lemma 5.3.
        
        Notice E and D must share a term of the opposite form and there
        are two possible cases for what this term is: (1) it exists in
        C or (2) it exists in the additional terms in E, ie, it does not
        exist in C. Either way the opposite term must exist in A or B
        since it must exist in D and D is composed of terms from A or B.
        Since A and B are both generic terms, it does not matter which
        clause the term exists in as long as it is fixed.

        Consider (1) the opposite form term exists in C

        Want to show $F_1$ can be derived by processing clauses with a maximum
        length of k - 1.

        Let the following clauses be defined:

        $G = [b, \beta, i, f, \phi]$ (By clause A and $C_1$ with Lemma 5.9)

        $H = [b, \beta, f, \phi, c, d, \delta]$ (By clause G and B with Lemma 5.9)

        Since all of the terms in $H$ exist in $F_1$, Lemma 5.8 can be used to
        derive $F_1$ from $H$.

        Want to show (1a) $G$ is shorter than $k$ and (1b) $H$ is shorter than $k$

        (1a) $G$ is shorter than $k$.

        In the following equations, let the presence of a term represent a count of one,
        and the presence of a set of terms represent the number of terms in that set. If
        multiple sets of terms are shown in parentheses, let this represent the number
        of terms found in both sets.
        
        Recall $F$ is of length k - 1 so k can be defined as follows:
        
        $k = b + c + d + f + g + h 
        + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
        - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
        - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        + 1
        $

        Length of $G = b + i + f + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi)$

        Want to show length of G is less than k:

        $b + i + f + \beta + \phi - (\beta \phi)$
        $<$
        $b + c + d + f + g + h 
        + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
        - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
        - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma) 
        + 1
        $

        $\rightarrow$ $b + i + f$
        $<$
        $b + c + d + f + g + h 
         + \delta + \gamma
        - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
        - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma) 
        + 1
        $

        Using a Venn Diagram or by other set intuition, the generic sets on the
        L.H.S. of the inequality represent the unique terms in $\beta$ and $\phi$.
        Similarly, the generic sets of the R.H.S. represent the unique terms
        in $\beta, \delta, \phi,$ and $\gamma$. 

        Subtracting the sets of generic terms on the L.H.S. from both sides
        yields the R.H.S. sets of generic terms as follows: the count
        of terms existing solely in $\delta$ + the count of terms existing
        solely in $\gamma$ + the count of terms existing solely in both $\delta$
        and $\gamma$.

        The lowest case for this is 0 if there are no terms that exist in 
        solely $\delta$, solely $\gamma$, or solely both $\delta$ and $\gamma$.

        In such a case, the inequality becomes:

        $b + i + f < b + c + d + f + g + h + 1$

        $\rightarrow$ $i < c + d + g + h + 1$

        Which is true as long as at least one term exists in {$c, d, g, h$}

        WTS at least one term has to exist in {$c, d, g, h$}.

        Suppose not, then no terms from {$c, d, g, h$} exist.

        Then some clauses are redefined:

        $B := [\delta, -i]$

        $E_1 := [-a, f, \phi, \gamma]$
        
        Recall that the number of terms in just $\delta$, $\gamma$, and 
        $\delta \cap \gamma$ is 0, so any terms in these sets have
        to exist in $\beta$ or $\phi$.

        Now in $E_1$ all of the terms in $\gamma$ have to exist in $\phi$
        or $\beta$. $E_1$ can be rewritten as:

        $E_1 := [-a, f, \phi, \gamma']$

        Where $\gamma'$ is a subset of $\beta$

        Similarly, $D$ can be rewritten as 

        $D := [a, b, \beta, \delta']$

        Where $\delta'$ is a subset of $\phi$

        Combining these with Lemma 5.9, we get a new clause

        $I = [f, b, \phi, \beta, \gamma', \delta']$

        But since $\gamma'$ and $\delta'$ are subsets of $\beta$ and
        $\phi$ respectively, these clauses only contain duplicates, so
        $I$ may be rewritten as:

        $I = [f, b, \phi, \beta]$

        The length of $I$ is clearly at most the length of $F$ since
        all the terms in $I$ exist in $F$. Therefore, the greatest length
        of $I$ is $k-1$. 
        
        Since $\gamma'$ and $\delta'$ are subsets of $\beta$ and $\phi$, 
        their lengths are at most the lengths of the latter sets.

        The longest $D$ is such that $\delta'$ is of the same length as
        $\phi$, which is the length of $I$.
        
        Recall the length of $D$ is given as $k$.

        $D$ cannot have a length of $k$ while also having a maximum length
        of $k - 1$.

        This is a contradiction, so at least one term has to exist in {$c, d, g, h$}
        so the length of $G$ is indeed less than k.

        (1b) Want to show $H$ is shorter than $k$

        Recall $F$ is of length $k - 1$, so we can define $k$ as follows:

        $k = b + c + d + f + g + h 
        + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
        - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
        - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        + 1
        $

        Length of $H = b + f + c + d 
        + \beta + \delta + \phi
        - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi)
        + (\beta \delta \phi) $

        Want to show the length of H is less than k.

        $b + f + c + d 
        + \beta + \delta + \phi
        - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\delta \phi)
        + (\beta \delta \phi) $
        $<$
        $b + c + d + f + g + h 
        + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
        - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
        - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        + 1
        $

        $\rightarrow$
        $b + f + c + d$
        $<$
        $b + c + d + f + g + h 
        + \gamma
        - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
        - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        + 1
        $

        The following is set intuition for the R.H.S. of the inequality:

                total & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                \hline
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

        This shows the generic sets on the R.H.S. consist of the terms that
        are in $\gamma$ and in no other set. This is lowest when all of the 
        terms in $\gamma$ exist in another set which would result in a sum of 0.

        The inequality therefore becomes:

        $\rightarrow$
        $b + f + c + d$
        $<$
        $b + c + d + f + g + h 
        + \gamma
        - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
        - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        + 1
        $

        $\rightarrow$
        $0 < g + h + 1$

        Which is always true.

        Therefore $H$ is shorter than $k$.

        Since $G$ and $H$ are shorter than $k$, we can derive $F$
        by only processing clauses with a maximum length of $k-1$.

        Consider (2) the opposite form term does not exist in C.

        We can create two new clauses:

        $J := [b, \beta, i, e, f, \phi, h, \gamma]$ (By clauses $E_2$ and $A$)

        $K := [c, d, \delta, b, \beta, e, f, \phi, h, \gamma]$ (By clauses $J$ and $B$)

        Since all of the terms in $K$ exist in $F_2$, Lemma 5.8 can be used
        to derive $F_2$ from $K$.

        % The generic terms on the R.H.S. represent all of the terms in $\delta$
        % that do not exist in any other set of generic terms.

        % The lowest value for this is 0 in the case where all of the terms in
        % $\delta$ exist in another set of terms.

        % The inequality becomes:

        % $\rightarrow$
        % $i < c + d + 1$

        % Which is true as long as one term exists in \{$c, d$\}

        % Want to show at least one term exists in $\{c, d\}$.

        % Suppose not. 

        % We can rewrite some clauses:
        
        % % $B := [\delta, -i]$
        
        % $D := [a, b, \beta, \delta']$

        % Where $\delta'$ is a subset of $\phi \cup \gamma$
        
        % Let's derive some more clauses:
        
        % $L := [b, \beta, \delta, e, f, \phi, h, \gamma]$ (By clauses D and $E_2$ by Lemma 5.9)
        
        % Recall all the terms $\delta$ must exist in another set.
        
        % This clause then becomes:

        % $L := [b, \beta, e, f, \phi, h, \gamma]$

        % Since all of the terms in $L$ exist in $F$, $L$ can imply $F$
        % by Lemma 5.8 and the maximum length of $L$ is k - 1.

        % Want to show length of D is at most the same as the length of L:

        % Since $\delta'$ is a subset of $\phi \cup \gamma$, the greatest
        % length of $\delta'$ is the length of $\phi \cup \gamma$.

        % In this case, the longest form of $D$ will take the form:

        % $D := [a, b, \beta, \phi, \gamma]$

        % Length of $D = 
        % a + b
        % + \beta + \phi + \gamma
        % - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        % + (\beta \phi \gamma)
        % $

        % Length of $L =

        % - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        % + (\beta \phi \gamma)
        % $

        % Want to show length of $D$ is less than or equal to $L$:

        % $
        % $\leq$
        % $b + e + f + h

        % - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)

        % $\rightarrow$
        % $a + b$
        % $\leq$
        % $b + e + f + h$

        % Which is true as long as at least two terms exist in {$b, e, f, h$}

        % WTS at least two terms exist in {$b, e, f, h$}

        % Suppose not, then a maximum of one term exists in {$b, e, f, h$}

        % Then $C_2$ can be rewritten:

        % $C_2 := [e]$

        % Because if there were any terms in {$f, \phi$}, we could extract
        % a term from $\phi$ to use as $f$ and we would have more than two 
        % terms from {$b, e, f, h$}


        % $E_2$ and $F_2$ can be rewritten as follows:

        % $E_2 = [e, -a, \phi, \gamma]$
        
        % $F_2 = [e, \beta, \phi, \gamma]$

        % Therefore the length of $D$ is shorter than $L$.

        % However, it was given that the length of $D$ is $k$. It is therefore
        % impossible for $D$ to have a maximum length of $k-1$.

        % Therefore, at least one term must exist in {$c, d$}.

        % Therefore the inequality holds and the length of $J$ is less than $k$.

        (2a) Want to show the length of $J$ is less than $k$
        
        We can define $k$ in terms of $F_2$:

        $k = b + c + d + e + f + h
        + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
        - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
        - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        + 1
        $

        Length of $J = 
        b + i + e + f + H
        + \beta + \phi + \gamma
        - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        + (\beta \phi \gamma)
        $

        Want to show the length of $J$ is less than $k$

        $b + i + e + f + H
        + \beta + \phi + \gamma
        - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        + (\beta \phi \gamma)
        $
        $<$
        $b + c + d + e + f + h
        + \beta + \delta + \phi + \gamma
        - (\beta \delta) - (\beta \phi) - (\beta \gamma) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma) - (\phi \gamma)
        + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\beta \phi \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
        - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        + 1
        $

        $\rightarrow$
        $i
        $
        $<$
        $c + d
        \delta
        - (\beta \delta) - (\delta \phi) - (\delta \gamma)
        + (\beta \delta \phi) + (\beta \delta \gamma) + (\delta \phi \gamma)
        - (\beta \delta \phi \gamma)
        + 1
        $

        Using a Venn Diagram or by other set intuition, the generic sets
        of terms on the R.H.S. represent the number of terms in $\delta$
        that do not exist in any other set.

        The lowest possible value for this is 0 and the inequality becomes:

        $i < c + d + 1$

        Which is true as long as one term exists in {$c, d$}

        Suppose not, then 

        $B := [-i]$

        Note that $\delta$ cannot have any terms because any terms from
        $\delta$ could be extracted to be treated as $c$ or $d$.

        Then D is recalculated:

        $D = [a, b, \beta]$

        We know D is of length k and A is of length k - 1.

        Here it is clearly seen the length of A is one more
        than the length of $D$ which is impossible since the 
        length of $A$ is k - 1 while the length of D is k.

        This is a contradiction, therefore at least one term must exist
        in {$c, d$}.

        Therefore the inequality holds and J is shorter than k.

        (2b) $K$ is shorter than $k$

        Recall 
        
        $K := [c, d, \delta, b, \beta, e, f, \phi, h, \gamma]$ (By clauses $J$ and $B$)

        $F_2 = [b, \beta, c, d, \delta, e, f, \phi, h, \gamma]$

        These two clauses are the same so $K$ has a length of $k-1$.
        
        Since $J$ and $K$ are shorter than $k$ and $J$ and $K$ can be used
        to derive $F_2$, we can derive $F_2$ by processing clauses with a 
        maximum length of $k-1$.

        Since $F_1$ and $F_2$ are all possible cases of $F$ and they 
        can be derived without processing clauses longer than length
        $k-1$, $F$ can be derived by processing only clauses with
        a maximum length of $k-1$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Given the following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item a clause $A$, of length less than k
            \item a clause $B$, of length less than k
            \item a clause $C$, of length k
            \item a clause $D$, of length k
            \item a clause $E$, of length k - 1
            \item $A$ expands to $C$ by lemma 5.8
            \item $B$ expands to $D$ by lemma 5.8
            \item $C$ and $D$ imply $E$ by lemma 5.7
        \end{itemize}
        Then $E$ can be derived by processing clauses whose length
        is at most k - 1.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        The following figure depicts the described clauses:

        \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{519a}

        Let the clauses be defined as follows:

        $A := [a, b, \beta]$

        $B := [c, d, \delta]$

        Then the following are derived:

        $C = [a, b, \beta, e, f, \phi]$

        $D = [c, d, \delta, g, h, \gamma]$

        $E = [a, b, \beta, e, f, \phi, c, d, \delta, g, h, \gamma]$

        Where $\beta, \delta, \phi,$ and $\gamma$ are fixed yet arbitrary
        set of terms in which the clauses block at least one assignment
        by Lemma 5.3.

        In order for C and D to imply E by Lemma 5.7, they have to be
        identical except for one term which is positive in one clause
        and negated in the other.

        There are 3 cases:
        (1) the opposite form term does not exist in A or B
        (2) the opposite form term exists in A or B
        (3) the opposite form term exists in A and B
        
        Consider case (1) the opposite form term does not exist in A or B.

        Then we fix one clause, say C, and redefine D in accordance with
        the requirements of Lemma 5.7. The clauses become:

        $C := [a, b, \beta, e, f, \phi]$

        $D := [a, b, \beta, -e, f, \phi]$

        $E = [a, b, \beta, f, \phi]$

        Notice that all of the terms in $A$ exist in $E$. Therefore, we
        can expand $A$, one term at a time by lemma 5.8, to derive
        $E$. Since a single term is added in each step, and $E$ is of length k - 1,
        the largest clause that needs to be processed is of length k - 2.

        Consider case (2) the opposite form term exists in either A or B.

        Again since C and D are both generic clauses derived in the same
        way from other generic clauses, we can fix either. Let's fix C
        and redefine D. The clauses become:

        $C := [a, b, \beta, e, f, \phi]$

        $D := [-a, b, \beta, e, f, \phi]$

        $E = [b, \beta, e, f, \phi]$

        We know $-a$ does not exist in $B$ and $B$ expands to $D$.

        The terms in $B$ are therefore a subset of the terms in $D$ not counting
        $-a$.

        More clearly {$c, d, \delta$} $\subset$ {$b, \beta, e, f, \phi$}

        Notice the set on the right is just all of the terms in E.

        Therefore all of the terms in B exist in E and we can expand
        B to E by Lemma 5.8.

        The greatest possible length of B is k - 1 and we know only one
        term gets appended in each step by Lemma 5.8 so we only have to
        process clauses with a maximum length of k - 1 to derive E.

        Consider case (3) the opposite form term exists in A and B.

        In this case, we redefine the clauses as follows:

        $A := [a, b, \beta]$

        $B := [-a, d, \delta]$

        $C = [a, b, \beta, e, f, \phi]$

        $D = [-a, d, \delta, g, h, \gamma]$

        $E = [b, \beta, e, f, \phi, d, \delta, g, h, \gamma]$

        In this case, by Lemma 5.7, A and B can imply a new clause:

        $F = [b, \beta, d, \delta]$

        whose terms are clearly a subset of the terms in $E$. As such, 
        $F$ can be used to derive $E$ by Lemma 5.8. Since Lemma 5.8 only
        adds a single term with each step and $E$ is of length k - 1 then
        the maximum length of $F$ is k - 1 (since it's a subset of E) and 
        you only have to process clauses with a maximum length of k - 1
        to derive E. 

        Therefore if you have clauses, A, B, C, D, and E, as described,
        E can be derived by processing clauses with a maximum length
        of k - 1.

    \section{Time Complexity Analysis}

    In this section I will analyze the time complexity of the algorithm in section 4

    (1) At most ${\binom{n}{3}}*8 + {\binom{n}{2}}*4 + {\binom{n}{1}}*2$ clauses to iterate which is on the order of

    $O(n^3)$

    (1.a) At most ${\binom{n}{3}}*8 + {\binom{n}{2}}*4 + {\binom{n}{1}}*2$ clauses to iterate which is on the order of

    $O(n^3)$

    (1.a.i) For each terminal in C, check if it's opposite form is in D

    $O(3^2)$ which is just constant time which is on the order of 

    $O(1)$

    (1.b) At most ${\binom{n}{1}} * 2$ clauses of length 1 exist, which is on the order of

    $O(n)$

    (1.b.i) At most ${\binom{n}{1}} * 2$ clauses of length 1 exist, which is on the order of

    $O(n)$

    (1.b.i.A) Constant time to check if two 1-terminal clauses contain the same terminal in the opposite form

    $O(1)$

    (2) Worst case, we add one new clause each time so we have to do (1) ${\binom{n}{3}} * 8 + {\binom{n}{2}} * 8 + {\binom{n}{1}} * 2$ which is on the order of

    $O(n^3)$

    (3) Constant time to check and return satisfiable

    $O(1)$

    The time complexity breaks down:

    $(2) * ((1) * ((1.a) * ((1.a.i)) + (1.b) * ((1.b.i) * (1.b.i.A)))) + (3)$

    $= O(n^3) * (O(n^3) * (O(n^3) * (O(1)) + O(n) * (O(n) * O(1)))) + O(1)$

    $= O(n^3) * (O(n^3) * (O(n^3) * (O(1)) + O(n) * O(n))) + O(1)$

    $= O(n^3) * (O(n^3) * (O(n^3) * (O(1)) + O(n^2))) + O(1)$

    $= O(n^3) * (O(n^3) * (O(n^3) + O(n^2))) + O(1)$

    $= O(n^3) * (O(n^3) * O(n^3)) + O(1)$

    $= O(n^3) * O(n^6) + O(1)$

    $= O(n^9) + O(1)$

    $= O(n^9)$

    \section{Proof of Correctness}

    Want to show an instance is unsatifiable iff we can derive contradicting
    1-terminal clauses by the algorithm.

    WTS Contradicting 1-terminal clauses can be derived $\implies$ the instance is unsatifiable

    Contradicting 1-terminal clauses take the form:

    [a]

    [-a]

    Where $a$ is a terminal in the problem.

    In all possible assignments, $a$ can have the value of True or False.

    If $a$ is True, the clause [-a] will be False and the assignment does not satisfy the instance.
    If $a$ is False, the clause [a] will be False and the assignment does not satisfy the instance.

    Since all possible assignments do not allow both clauses to be true, 
    the instance is unsatifiable.

    WTS Unsatisfiable $\implies$ the algorithm will derive contradicting 1-terminal clauses

    By Lemma 5.14, the given 3-terminal clauses can be expanded to every
    possible n-terminal clause.

    By Lemma 5.15 these n-terminal clauses can be reduced by Lemma 5.7
    to derive contradicting 1-terminal clauses.

    So we know if we can derive these n-terminal clauses, we can derive
    contradicting 1-terminal clauses.

    The way in which we derive these 1-terminal clauses is we use
    Lemma 5.7 to reduce the current set of k-terminal clauses to
    a set of (k-1)-terminal clauses. We repeat for all k from n to 2
    inclusive.

    Notice this passes through every possible k from length 2 to n.

    Recall that deriving all of the n-terminal clauses was done by using
    Lemma 5.8.

    These n-terminal clauses were then used to derive clauses of length n - 1
    by Lemma 5.7.

    By Lemma 5.18, such a case allows us to derive the clauses of length n - 1
    without ever having to process a clause of length n.

    Now we have all of the clauses of length n - 1 that we would have derived
    if we processed clauses of length n.

    Note how each of these clauses are either derived from given clauses
    by Lemma 5.8 or by Lemma 5.9 (all Lemma 5.7 derivations are a subset
    of all Lemma 5.9 derivations).

    We now want to use these (n-1)-terminal clauses to derive clauses
    of length (n-2), but we want to do it without processing clauses
    whose length is larger than (n-2).

    Since it takes two (n-1)-terminal clauses to derive a (n-2)-terminal
    clause by Lemma 5.7, the possible clauses could be of the form:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item both clauses were derived by Lemma 5.8 (expansion)
        \item both cluases were derived by Lemma 5.9 (reduction/implication)
        \item each clause was derived in a different manner
    \end{enumerate}

    Note that this list is exhaustive because these are the only manner
    of implications used in the Lemmas that allowed us to derive these clauses.

    We can use the following lemmas to handle each case:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Lemma 5.19
        \item Lemma 5.17
        \item Lemma 5.18
    \end{enumerate}

    As such we can derive the clauses of length n - 2 without processing
    a clause whose length is larger than n - 2.

    In a more general sense, for every $w$ from $1$ to $n-3$, 
    we know we have clauses of length $n-w$ that we want to use to
    derive clauses of length $n-w-1$ and since we derived the clauses
    of length $n-w$ only using Lemma 5.9 (which is a more general form
    of 5.7) and Lemma 5.8, we know all clauses of length $n-w$ have to
    be derived one of those two ways. We use two $n-w$-t clauses to 
    derive a clause of length $n-w-1$ so the list of three ways these
    clauses could be derived is exclusive. Since we have Lemmas 5.17, 
    5.18, and 5.19, all of these cases allow us to derive the clause
    of length $n-w-1$ without processing a clause longer than $n-w-1$.
    As such, we can derive all of the clauses we need down to clauses
    of length 4. Again since all clauses of length 4 or greater were
    implied either by Lemma 5.8 (expansion) or Lemma 5.9 (reduction/implication).

    At this point, we have 4-terminal clauses and we want to derive 3-terminal
    clauses. We need two clauses and we can either include a 3-terminal clause
    or we cannot.

    If we don't include a 3-terminal clause, then Lemmas 5.17-5.19 can be
    used and we can imply the 3-terminal clause without processing clauses
    of length 3 or higher.

    If we do use a 3-terminal clause, then the other clause has to be 4-terminal,
    but Lemma's 5.17-5.19 only cover cases where the implying clauses were
    themselves derived. Since we are given 3-terminal clauses, there are some
    clauses which are not derived. Now we want to show any 3-terminal clause
    implied by a 4-terminal clause can be derived by processing clauses of length
    no more than 3. The 4-terminal clause can either be derived by Lemma 5.9 or
    expanded to by Lemma 5.8. In the former case, we can use Lemma 5.11 and in 
    the latter case we can use Lemma 5.12. In both cases, we can derive all the 
    necessary 3-terminal clauses while processing clauses with a maximum length
    of 3.

    We can now reduce the 3-terminal clauses to 1-terminal clauses.

    Since we got all the necessary 3-terminal clauses without having
    to process a 4-terminal clause, this clearly shows we do not
    have to process any clauses of length 4 or greater to derive contradicting 1-t
    clauses.
    
    Even though the algorithm only explicitly uses Lemma 5.9, this will
    cover cases where reduction is needed because Lemma 5.9 is a more
    general case of Lemma 5.7. This also covers cases where expansion by
    Lemma 5.8 is needed because you would only need to expand up to 
    clauses of length 3 and Lemmas 5.17, 5.18, and 5.19 already show
    any clauses that this would derive would already be derived

    Therefore, this coincides with the described algorithm.

    Additionally, this description only requires processing clauses
    of length 3 or less, which is upper bounded by $O(n^3)$.

    \section{Conclusion} 

    In this paper, we present an algorithm to solve 3SAT in polynomial time.

    By the (Karp's paper), 3SAT is NP-complete, meaning 3SAT is at least
    as hard as every problem in NP.
    
    Since we have an algorithm to solve 3SAT in polynomial time, then all problems
    in NP can be solved in polynomial time.

    Thus, P = NP.

    TODO:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item reorder definitions
        \item redo Lemma 3.18
        \item Perhaps modify the algo to use expansion or add another lemma
        to say 'expansion is equivalent to the current algo if we only deal with
        1-, 2-, 3-, terminal clauses'
        \item correct a lot of 'by Lemma 5.6' to 'by Lemma 5.8'
        \item for lemmas where the final is length k - 1, make sure you
        don't rely on the given clauses being of lengh k - 1 :(
    \end{itemize}
