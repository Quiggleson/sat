# Lemma :O - two clauses differing by a single negation hold an implication
Two clauses, say [1, 2, 3] and [1, 2, -3] that differ by a single negation
imply a blockage for all clauses where x_1 = 0 and x_2 = 0.
This is denoted by a two terminal clause [1, 2] where 1 or 2 must be true
for the instance to be satisfiable

this is useful because in essence it becomes more like a 2SAT instance
